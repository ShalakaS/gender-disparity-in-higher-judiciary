# Acute Gender Disparity Among Higher Judiciary in India

This story is a product of analysis of data of professional details of high court and supreme court judiciary in India between 1994 and 2021.

The current Chief Justice of India (2023), DY Chandrachud, is known as a liberal mascot of the otherwise conservative judiciary. His tenure has seen some landmark judgements that have helped people overturn government's policy decisions that were not favorable to several sections of the society. Because the removal of a high court or supreme court judge is a tedious process due to the posts being constitutional in nature, the only way the legislators can get any say in judiciary is through appointment of these judges. The current collegium system ensures that the government gets no say in appointment of higher judiciary. But on the flip side of this iron-clad and often-debated upon system of appointment, it has become an impenetrable boys' club. So what happens when Justice Chandrachud retires? Who will voice the opinions of people who do not identify as men? Where are the women in the system?

There was no centralized data to quantify this claim until a data collective called Justice Hub, collected and published the information through summer programmes in which law students helped in grassroot data collection. The gender-related data is binary in nature and the analysis has retained the terminology.

Two analysis ipynb notebooks inside the data-stitiching-analysis folder will help you navigate and KHOJ data and form a csv file that has the data of all judges appointed since 1994. 

The first notebook (KHOJ-analysis) puts all 25 csv files together.
The second notebook (Untitled.ipynb) was used to derive data for the data visualizations.

*The final analysis had to drop 74 names due to insufficient datapoints*
